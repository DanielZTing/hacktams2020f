      "text": "A hackathon is a coding marathon where students come together to create an innovative project within only 48 hours! Projects include websites, mobile apps, machine learning apps, hardware, and more that cover a variety of topics such as COVID-19, saving the planet, improving daily tasks, etc. Your creativity is your only limitation!"

      "title": "Unique Tracks",
      "text": "hackTAMS will have two distinct tracks this year: Hack and Design. The Hack track is geared towards students who have an interest in computer science and those who want to build a working prototype. In other words, this is your typical hackathon competition. In contrast, the Design track is for students who do not enjoy programming but have a creative passion for making things! For this track, you need to submit a mockup of your project."

      "title": "Resources and Mentorship",
      "text": "hackTAMS plans to support hackers virtually by providing interesting technical workshops and access to personalized mentorship. Additionally, we will provide access codes to developer tools from our sponsors. These resources will be available to everyone free of cost and are an amazing way to learn something new and perhaps apply your knowledge on your hackathon project!"

      "title": "Future Opportunities",
      "text": "Although we hope you attend and enjoy our event, our main goal is to enable you as software engineers, graphic designers, data scientists, and mobile app developers to explore the world of hackathons. Through hackathons, you can find unique opportunities such as internships, networking, and resume building."
